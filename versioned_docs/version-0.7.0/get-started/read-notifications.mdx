:::tip

[Install the GraphQL packages](/get-started/quick-setup/) before starting this section.

:::

In this section, we'll help you write a simple query to read a user's [notifications](/concepts/notifications/) from the [social graph](/concepts/social-graph/).

1. Initialize the GraphQL client:

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetConnections.tsx"
const client = new GraphQLClient(CYBERCONNECT_ENDPOINT);
```

2. Write a query to get the `unreadNotificationCount` and the list of the userâ€™s `notifications`:

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetNotifications.tsx"
export const GET_NOTIFICATIONS = gql`
  query ($address: String!) {
    identity(address: $address, network: ETH) {
      unreadNotificationCount
      notifications {
        pageInfo {
          hasNextPage
          hasPreviousPage
          endCursor
          startCursor
        }
        list {
          id
          toAddress
          network
          namespace
          hasRead
          type
          timestamp
          ... on NewConnectionNotification {
            fromAddress
            connectionType
          }
          ... on BiConnectReceivedNotification {
            fromAddress
          }
          ... on BiConnectAcceptedNotification {
            fromAddress
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```
