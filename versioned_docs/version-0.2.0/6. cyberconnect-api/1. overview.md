## How does it work?

The indexer layer of the CyberConnect Protocol collects on-chain data from blockchain networks (e.g. Ethereum, Solana) as well as off-chain data from IPFS and web2 social platforms. The indexer then transforms and stores the raw data into graph databases. Developers can access the data and customize their queries using the GraphQL API.
