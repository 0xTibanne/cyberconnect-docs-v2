## Connecting to the app

We have to make sure that the user is connecting to the application using a wallet. In our example we will write the logic for the connection to the application using MetaMask, one of the most popular wallets out there.

Connecting to the application is a simple process that can be accomplished with just a few lines of code and we'll create a `ConnectButton` component for that:

1. Write a simple `isMetaMaskInstalled` check function to verify that the user has the MetaMask wallet installed:

```jsx title="/src/components/ConnectButton.tsx"
// Check function if MetaMask is installed
const isMetaMaskInstalled = () => {
    const { ethereum } = window;
    return Boolean(ethereum && ethereum.isMetaMask);
};
```

2. Write the logic inside `handleOnClick` for sending a request to MetaMask and, if successful, alert with the wallet address the user is connecting with:

```jsx title="/src/components/ConnectButton.tsx"
const handleOnClick = async () => {
    if (isMetaMaskInstalled()) {
        // Request to connect to MetaMask
        try {
            const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
                method: "eth_requestAccounts"
            });
            alert(`Connected with: ${accounts[0]}`);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(error.message);
        }
    } else {
        alert("Please install MetaMask.");
    }
};
```

3. Let's finish up our code by assigning the `handleOnClick` function you've written in the previous step to the `onClick` handler on the `button`:

```jsx title="/src/components/ConnectButton.tsx"
<button className="connectButton" onClick={handleOnClick}>
    Connect wallet
</button>
```

That's it! Your `ConnectButton` component is now completed and your user can now connect to your app using the MetaMask wallet!

## Create a follow button

Now our focus will turn on creating a connection and for that you'll need to create a `FollowButton` component that will handle the logic for that:
1. Install the `@cyberlab/cyberconnect` SDK:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @cyberlab/cyberconnect
```

2. Import from the SDK `CyberConnect`, `Env` and `Blockchain` in your application:

```jsx title="/src/components/FollowButton.tsx"
import CyberConnect, {
    Env,
    Blockchain,
} from '@cyberlab/cyberconnect';
```

3. In order to create a connection you'll first have to instantiate  `CyberConnect` and pass it the following variables: `namespace`, `env`, `chain` and `provider`:

```jsx title="/src/components/FollowButton.tsx"
const cyberConnect = new CyberConnect({
    namespace: "CyberConnect",
    env: Env.PRODUCTION,
    chain: Blockchain.ETH,
    provider: window.ethereum
});
```

4. Using the same approach as the one with `ConnectButton`, now will write the logic for the connection (a.k.a. follow) inside the `handleOnClick` function and assign it to the `onClick` handler on the `button` element:

```jsx title="/src/components/FollowButton.tsx"
const handleOnClick = async () => {
    // Prompt to enter the address
    const address = prompt("Enter the ens/address to follow:");

    try {
        await cyberConnect.connect(address);
        alert(`Success: you're following ${address}!`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error.message);
    }
};
```

```jsx title="/src/components/FollowButton.tsx"
<button className="followButton" onClick={handleOnClick}>
    Follow address
</button>
```

That's a wrap! Your `FollowButton` is now complete and your users are able to connect with other addresses on the Ethereum network.

You find the entire code and play around with it in the sandbox:

Congrats! You've officialy created your first connection using the CyberConnect SDK! ðŸŽ‰

You're now ready to move on to the next step and implement the Social Verifier in your application.
