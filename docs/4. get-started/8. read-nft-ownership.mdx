In this section you'll learn how to write a query in order to read the NFT ownership.

### Install the necessary dependencies
```bash npm2yarn
npm install graphql graphql-request
```

### Initialize the GraphQL Client
```jsx title="/src/queries/GetNFTOwnership.tsx"
const client = new GraphQLClient(CYBERCONNECT_ENDPOINT);
```

### Write the query

```jsx title="/src/queries/GetNFTOwnership.tsx"
export const GET_NFT_OWNERSHIP = gql`
    query($contract: String!, $tokenId: String) {
        nftOwners(contract: $contract, tokenId: $tokenId) {
            tokenId
            owner
            twitter {
                handle
            }
        }
    }
`;
```

You can test or write your own query in our [Playground](/cyberconnect-api/playground/) or simply make changes in the sandbox below:
