## Introduction

**CyberConnect Developer Center** is a perfect space for developers to learn about the CyberConnect Protocol, get inspired, and start building meaningful social experiences for users.

The purpose of the **CyberConnect Protocol** is to empower users to take full ownership over their social data while traversing the web3 world. By plugging into the decentralized social graph, developers are provided with a universal data layer to build the next generation of dApps.

## Setup

CyberConnect Developer Center is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
<br></br>

### Prerequisites

Before running any commands in your CLI, make sure that you have [Node 12 or better](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.
<br></br>

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

This command will install all the packages that are necessary to start the development server.
<br></br>

### .env
Sign up to [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) and create an application then update the following variables in `.env` file:

- `ALGOLIA_APP_ID=`
- `ALGOLIA_API_KEY=`
- `ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=`
<br></br>

### Local Development
